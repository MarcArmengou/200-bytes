# 200 Byes

## About

The sequel to 100 Bytes Theme (https://wordpress.org/themes/100-bytes/). We have gained 100 bytes of weight. Maybe gaining weight is a good idea here. My doctor didn't say anything about this.

The idea is simple, make a theme that looks good everywhere, with as little CSS code as possible. In this case the limit is 200 Bytes of CSS information.

Actually the compressed CSS code contains 180 bytes of information, but 200 bytes sounds better.

- No functions or styles for comments.
- No functions or styles for menus.
- Yes styles to read well everywhere.
